# home_fm

This litte project aims to do the following:
- play music on a random device that is able to open a browser

It tries to achieve this by doing the following things:
- index music files stored on an own server
- implement operations as REST webservices, to allow various clients
- provide a simple interface, where playlists can be managed
- provide another interface, where playlists can be selected and played

The whole thing is planned to be run in a home network configuration, so there will be no authentication or authorization.
